## Terms and Conditions

Version 1.0 (01 March 2018)
### What is Duesday 🤔

Duesday is the brand name of CFT Group Ltd, a limited company registered in sunny Cornwall.

The legal terms in this document (English law applies) are between you and CFT Group Ltd (Duesday/us/we) and you agree to them by using the Duesday app.

You should read this document along with our Privacy Policy.
### How to contact us 💬

You can contact us through the Duesday app, by email at support@duesday.com, by phone on 03331122999 or by letter to: Duesday, 2 Pike Street, Liskeard, PL14 3HS.

We will contact you via the Duesday app, or through your email, phone or home address. Please let us know if any of these change! You can update your details directly in the app.
### Setting up your details 🔒

To use our service you have to verify your name, mobile number, email address and residential address. We are required to collect these details to prevent Duesday being used for fraud or money laundering. We store all of your details in a secretly encrypted format inside a secure digital vault.

From time to time or when your details change we may ask you to re-verify the personal information we hold for you. If you don't verify those details we may not be able to pay bills on your behalf and you must find other ways to pay the company or provider which billed you. 

To pay your bills through Duesday you need to provide us with your bank account and/or card details and agree to our terms. We store your bank account details in secretly encrypted formats in a secure digital vault. Your payment card details are not stored by us at all, but instead we receive a secure payment token for your bill payments which can only be used by Duesday.
### How we pay your bills 💷

We use Direct Debits to pay bills from your bank account and continuous payment authority to pay bills with your Visa or Mastercard. Our Duesday app lets you see which bills need to be paid and when they're due. For some bills, but not all, you can change when and how the payment is taken. The amount you pay will be transferred to our Duesday account and from there to the company or provider which billed you. 


### If something goes wrong 😱

Please keep your phone and Duesday passcode safe at all times.

We might be able to refund any money you lost due to our mistakes or inaccuracies with your payments or due to fraudulent activity on your account.

However, you won’t be able to claim losses if:

- you have carelessly failed to keep your phone and passcode safe
- you broke the terms of this agreement
- you gave us incorrect instructions (but we’ll do our best to help you recover your money)
- we took actions under conditions outside of our control
- they are not the direct and predictable result of our actions

### How to make a complaint 😔

If you have a complaint, please contact us and we will do our best to fix the problem by emailing: support@duesday.com.

If you’re still not happy, you can refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service. For more details you can visit their website at www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk.
### Making changes to this agreement 📝

This agreement will always be available in the app and on our website.

If we make changes to it that are clearly in your favour, we’ll tell you once they’ve been made. Otherwise we will give you two months’ notice.

If you don’t agree to these changes, you can let us know and we will close your account.
### Closing your account 😭

To close your account, please get in touch with us. Any money you owe us will have to be repaid before the account can be closed. Once the account is closed, all your preferences will be deleted and no future bills will be paid through Duesday.

This step cannot be undone. Your Duesday account will be closed and all your bills and preferences will be removed.

We can close your account by giving you at least two months’ notice. We may close your account or suspend use of your app immediately if we believe you have:

- broken the terms of this agreement
- put us in a position where we might break the law
- broken the law or attempted to break the law
- given us false information at any time
- behaved in an abusive manner to anyone at Duesday or a member of the Duesday community

### What happens if I can’t pay my Direct Debits?
We know that there are times when people fall behind with payments, for a variety of reasons.

If you are struggling to pay your Duesday Direct Debits, we want you to speak to us. We will always be able to help, and we don’t want to add to your worry.

And we know that people can be in debt with lots of other organisations or individuals. We recognise that this can be a difficult time and we can support you.

If you are missing your scheduled payments, this is how you will be contacted:

#### Text message contact 📩
First we will send you a text message or an in-app notification to let you know that we need to take a payment to bring your account up to date.


#### Email contact 📩
If you haven't taken action to address your debt we will follow up with an email.
We’ll then send another text message and email asking you to contact us as soon as possible.

Let us know if you're having problems making payment - get in touch straight away.

If a period of time after our first communication with you about your account we haven’t heard back, you’ll get a text and email asking to arrange a date and time for us to call you and discuss the best options.

#### Reminder to get in touch 📆

A final reminder will be sent by email and text message if after several weeks we have not heard back from you. At this stage if you have not contacted us we will have to take further action.

If you are falling behind with payments and want to talk about managing your account please email us on support@duesday.com
